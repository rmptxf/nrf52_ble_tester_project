A project based on the nRF5 SDK that uses the segger toolchain, and inlcude many features such as the saadc, app_button, ble, custom service and more.

The project part 1 (nRF52 firmware) is under **nRF5SDK/v16/projects/ble_peripheral**.

I also added the android app (apk file), so you can easilly test that on your mobile too.

The ionic project files are under the **ionic-project** folder.
